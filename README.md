# dtx-submit-holidays
This is a TamperMonkey script (a browser extension) which alters the code for the web DTX MyHolidays and SubmitHolidays pages.

1. Alters MyHolidays page to allow checkbox selection to work in Chrome.
2. Alters SubmitHolidays page, so you don't have to hit Enter after picking a verifier in the selection box.
